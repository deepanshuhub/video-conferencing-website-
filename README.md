HOW TO RUN::
To run this code in Visual Studio Code, you'll need to follow these steps:

Open Visual Studio Code and create a new JavaScript file with a .js extension, for example, videoConferenceServer.js.

Copy and paste the JavaScript code you provided into the videoConferenceServer.js file.

Install the required dependencies by opening the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code (press Ctrl+`or go toView>Terminal>New Terminal`).

In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your JavaScript file is located, using the cd command. For example, if your file is in the Desktop directory, you can use:
<cd Desktop>

Install the websocket library by running the following command in the terminal:
<npm install websocket>

Once the installation is complete, you can run the WebSocket server by executing the JavaScript file with Node.js. In the terminal, run the following command:

<node videoConferenceServer.js>
This will start the server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is listening on port 1337.

Your WebSocket server should now be up and running. It will handle incoming connections, receive and broadcast messages from connected clients. You can use a WebSocket client to connect to the server and test the functionality.

Please note that this is a basic implementation of a WebSocket server and doesn't include the WebRTC functionality for video conferencing. If you're looking to implement video conferencing with WebRTC, you'll need to use additional libraries and APIs specific to WebRTC, such as RTCPeerConnection, getUserMedia, and MediaStream APIs.
